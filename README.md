# Wordpress Theme: Starter üìñ

This is a starter theme for Wordpress utilizing a modern build process with webpack 5.

üí° there are two webpack instances. The one in the root (with budJS) is for developers. While the one in ``./src/templates/`` 
is meant for HTML/CSS template designers. There is no need for developers to touch it, unless you want to view the
 design. If so, follow the steps for designers.

These technologies are used:

- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [bud.js](https://bud.js.org/) for the compilation process
- [sass/scss](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Javascript ES6](https://javascript.info/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [node (v18)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [github workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows)

# A quick word about bud.js üíÆ

bud.js is a javascript build framework with add-on support for Babel, React, PostCSS, Sass, Typescript, esbuild, ESLint, Prettier, and more.
In this project we use it to handle the entire build process.

The config file is located at `bud.config.mjs`. It contains Javascript, so we can do any processing with nodeJS to pass arguments. Or edit the config file to change the build process.

#### What the heck is ```.mjs```? It's the extension for "Javascript Modules" --> https://docs.fileformat.com/web/mjs/

Place further extensions for bud in ``./src/bud/``. ``./src/bud/createFontFile.mjs`` is an extension that writes all the font files into a scss file.

# Installation ‚õ∫

[OPTIONAL] First of all, get yourself [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to switch node versions on the fly.

If you want to switch to a different node version, you can do it with the following command:

```bash
nvm use <version>
```

The minimal version of node needed is visible in ``package.json`` at ``"engines": {...}``. Most likely it is going to be v18.4.0

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install the dependencies with the following command:

| yarn             | npm             |
|------------------|-----------------|
| ``yarn install`` | ``npm install`` |

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the development server:

| yarn         | npm             |
|--------------|-----------------|
| ``yarn dev`` | ``npm run dev`` |

This will start watching the files and recompile them when they change. Everything is injected via the main javascript file with browserSync.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Build for production:

| yarn           | npm               |
|----------------|-------------------|
| ``yarn build`` | ``npm run build`` |

ü§¨ Stuck on install?
```
[5/5] Building fresh packages...
[1/2] ‚†Å @roots/bud
[-/2] ‚†Å waiting...
```
| yarn           | npm               |
|----------------|-------------------|
| ``yarn clean`` | ``npm run clean`` |

## Common issues üí©

1) Having an error locally or in Github actions / workflows (Something like ``ENOENT`` for example)?
Try removing the ``yarn.lock`` file and ``node_modules`` folder. Start the installation process again.

# BrowserSync with static HTML & CSS - for Designers üé®

Go to your folder ``./src/templates/`` and open it.

---

üü† Select the Node version needed (default v18.4.0) with ``Node Version Manager``

| nvm                   | example            |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| ``nvm use <version>`` | ``nvm use 18.4.0`` |

tip: you can use ``nvm use 18``, and it will use the most recent version of it.

üü° Install the dependencies with the following command:

| yarn             | npm             |
|------------------|-----------------|
| ``yarn install`` | ``npm install`` |

üü¢ Run browserSync:

| yarn         | npm             |
|--------------|-----------------|
| ``yarn dev`` | ``npm run dev`` |


‚ú® BrowserSync is running on port 8080 now. It should automatically open the URL ``http://localhost:8080``.
Your browser should now reload on changes made in HTML, CSS or Javascript.

---

üîµ OPTIONAL: build the files. (this has no influence on the commit)

| yarn           | npm               |
|----------------|-------------------|
| ``yarn build`` | ``npm run build`` |

In general there is no need for this.

‚òòÔ∏è Extras:

- Filepath for images: ``../../images/<image-name>.jpg``
- Use filepath from images. Not from the dist folder. Subfolders are accepted.
- Javascript goes into ``./src/templates/index.js``

# Adding HTML files and viewing them - for Designers üç≠

This is done automatically when running or building.

Webpack will look for the files called ``index.html``, ``teaser.html``, ``about.html``, and ``contact.html`` in the HTML folder.
Accessing them is simple. Just add the filename behind your browserSync URL: ``http://localhost:8080/teaser.html``


# BrowserSync with Wordpress - for Devs üëæ

Go to your running website. For example:

``http://localhost/your_project/``

Start the development server (2Ô∏è‚É£).
Then add the port specified in the ``bud.config.mjs`` file (default **``:3010``** or ``:3000``) to your path:

````http://localhost:3010/your_project/````

Your browser should now reload on changes made in CSS or Javascript.


# Hot reloading in Wordpress üî•

Start the development server (2Ô∏è‚É£), then add the port to your URL and enjoy the magic.

---

# Javascript üíª

This projects requires you to use ES6 conventions. Like the extensions ``.mjs`` (module javascript) and ``.cjs`` (common javascript _for compatibility_).
``require()`` will not work. However you will have to use [ES6 imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import):

```js
import defaultExport from "module-name";
// or
import { export1 } from "module-name";
```

# Fonts in sass üñ§

Add your font files to the ``./src/fonts/`` folder. The files will be compiled into the dynamic ``./src/fonts/inlineFonts.scss`` file.
If you import that file into SCSS the fonts will be available in your CSS as variables.

``./src/fonts/webfont_open_sans.woff`` will be available in SCSS as ``$webfont_open_sans_woff``.
 
‚ö†Ô∏èThe fonts are only recompiled on initial run of ``dev`` or ``build``, and are not watched.

# Inlining Assets ü•Ω
Since bud 6.6.6
```CSS
.example {
    background: url(@src/test.svg?inline)
}
```

# Images/Icons üñº

Images and icons are copied into the ``./dist/`` folder and can be referenced in HTML and SASS.


| Plain HTML                                 | SASS / SCSS                       |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ``src="../../dist/logo-lanz-stripes.svg"`` | ``url(../../images/sprite.svg)``  |

‚ö†Ô∏èNote that in plain HTML you reference the built files in the ``./dist/`` folder, however in SASS/SCSS you reference the files in the ``./src/images/`` folder (uncompiled).

# Loading Assets in PHP / Wordpress üêò

It is as simple as getting the correct path to the file you need. Don't forget to run or build your project,
so the assets are available. Still confused? Check the ``./dist/manifest.json`` file, which contains all the paths to the files.

```php
apply_filters( 'get_file_from_dist', 'images/ico/example.png' );
```


# Github Workflows üöÄ

Workflows are located in the ``.github/workflows/`` folder.

# For Developers üéÆ

Functions, Classes and Methods are to be documented. Use this convention:
[PHP Docstrings](http://phpdocu.sourceforge.net/howto.php)

You should use the same convention for Javascript.

```php
/**
* The short description
*
* As many lines of extendend description as you want {@link element} links to an element
* {@link http://www.example.com Example hyperlink inline link} links to a website
* Below this goes the tags to further describe element you are documenting
*
* @param  	type	$varname	description
* @return 	type	description
* @access 	public or private
* @author 	author name 
* @copyright	name date
* @version	version
* @see		name of another element that can be documented, produces a link to it in the documentation
* @link		a url
* @since  	a version or a date
* @deprecated	description
* @deprec	alias for deprecated
* @magic	phpdoc.de compatibility
* @todo		phpdoc.de compatibility
* @exception	Javadoc-compatible, use as needed
* @throws  	Javadoc-compatible, use as needed
* @var		type	a data type for a class variable
* @package	package name
* @subpackage	sub package name, groupings inside of a project
*/
```

Example:
```php
/**
* return the day of the week
*
* @param string $month 3-letter Month abbreviation
* @param integer $day day of the month
* @param integer $year year
* @return integer 0 = Sunday, value returned is from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday)
*/
function day_week($month, $day, $year)
{
...
}
```
